# TRF-Tools
Tools for data analysis with temporal response functions (TRFs). This repository mostly contains tools that extend Eelbrain but are not deemed stable enough to be included in the release.

## Installing

TRF-Tools should be installed with `pip` into a recent [`eelbrain` environment](https://github.com/christianbrodbeck/Eelbrain/wiki/Installing).
